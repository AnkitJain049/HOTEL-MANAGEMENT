Project Title: Hotel Management System using Tkinter, MySQL, and Python

Description:
This project is a GUI-based hotel management system designed to handle various aspects of hotel operations, such as customer data entry, extra service requests, and cost calculation.
The system utilizes the Tkinter library for creating a user-friendly graphical interface.
It incorporates a MySQL database for storing and managing customer data, room details, and service records.
Features:

Customer Data Entry:
Allows users to input their personal information, such as name, phone number, check-in/out dates, and room preference.
Validates user input for correct format and data integrity.
Extra Services:

Provides options for customers to request additional services, including an extra bed, restaurant bills, game center expenses, and laundry service.
Calculates and updates the total bill based on selected services.
Total Cost Calculation:

Computes the total bill for each customer, including room rent, extra services, and applicable taxes (18% GST).
Displays a breakdown of individual costs, tax, and the final payable amount.
Database Integration:

Utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage customer information, room records, and service expenses.
Employs SQL queries to retrieve, update, and insert data into the database.
Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python
GUI Library: Tkinter
Database: MySQL
Project Flow:

The main window offers options to enter customer data, request extra services, and calculate the total cost.
Each functionality is linked to a specific window with input fields, checkboxes, and buttons.
The data entered by the user is validated before being processed and stored in the database.
Contributions:

Created a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, facilitating user-friendly interactions.
Designed the MySQL database schema to store customer information, room details, and service records.
Implemented data validation to ensure accurate and consistent input.
Incorporated SQL queries for database operations such as insertion, retrieval, and updating records.
Outcome:

The hotel management system streamlines and automates various tasks, enhancing efficiency and customer experience.
Provides users with a simple and intuitive way to input their data, select services, and obtain cost estimates.
Demonstrates proficiency in GUI development, database integration, and Python programming.
Learning Experience:

Acquired skills in GUI development using Tkinter and interfacing it with a MySQL database.
Gained experience in handling user input, data validation, and implementing database operations.
Enhanced problem-solving abilities by addressing various aspects of hotel management through code.
Future Enhancements:

Implement user authentication and access control for enhanced security.
Develop reporting and analytics features for monitoring hotel operations.
Extend the project to include more advanced features such as online booking and payment processing.
